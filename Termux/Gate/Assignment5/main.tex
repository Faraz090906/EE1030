		%4th Question
	\item Robot Ltd. wishes to maintain enough safety stock during the lead time period between starting a new production run and its completion such that he probability of satisfying the customer demand during the lead time period is $95\%$. The lead time period in 5 days and daily customer demand can be assumed to follow the Gaussian (normal) distribution with mean 50 units and a standard deviation of 10 units. Using $\phi^{-1}\brak{0.95} = 1.64$, where $\phi$ respresents the cummulative distribution function of the standard normal random variable, the amount of safety stock that must be maintained by Robot Ltd. to achieve this demand fulfillment probability for the lead time period \rule{2cm}{0.1pt} \brak{\text{round off to decimal places}}.

	\item A rigid insulated tank is initially evacuated. It is connected through a value to a supply line that carries air at a constant pressure and temperature of $250 kPa$ and $400 K$ respectively. Now the valve is opened and air is allowed to flow into the tank until the pressure inside the tank reaches to $250 kPa$ at which point valve is closed. Assume that the air beaves as a perfect gas with constant properties. $\brak{c_p = 1.005 \frac{kJ}{\brak{kg-K}}, c_v = 0.718 \frac{kJ}{\brak{kg-K}}, R = 0.287 \frac{kJ}{\brak{kg-K}}}$.Final temperature of the air inside the tank is \rule{1cm}{0.1pt} K \brak{\text{round off to one decimal places}}
